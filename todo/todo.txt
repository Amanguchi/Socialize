//==========================================
// To do for Socialize



1. CSS Layout. Move the code modular to the 3rd column and center it.


5. fix angular controllers for organization.

6. Font isn't working

7. problem if a person hits enter for the alert value test function then it will loop
with the empty field. sigh...




//==========================================

//Ideas

In the future, I think it would be great if the user can enter
their own width and height attributes to the image.
