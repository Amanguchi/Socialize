// To do for Socialize



1. CSS Layout. Move the code modular to the 3rd column and center it.


5. fix angular controllers for organization.

6. create back to top scroll in jQuery

7. height and width not restting.

//==========================================

//Ideas

In the future, I think it would be great if the user can enter
their own width and height attributes to the image.
