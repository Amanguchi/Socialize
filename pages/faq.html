<h3>What is Socialize?</h3>

<p>
  Socialize was made for people who need help adding images to their site. Included in their code is an image of the
  site picked and the code.
</p>
<h3>How do I use Socialize?</h3>
<p>
   All you have to do is select which social media site you would like to use and enter your URL for your own
    link. Socialize will output code for you to paste anywhere onto your website!
</p>

<h3>My favorite site isn't here!</h3>

<p>
  Sorry about that, just click the Suggestions tab on the site and you can alert me what site you would want!
</p>

<h3>Can I help with the website?</h3>
<p>
  The Socialize website and code is all open source. It is written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Angular JS and JQuery.
